<p>Ezra Klein, writing at Vox:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But on Monday night, St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch
released the evidence given to the grand jury, including the
interview police did with Wilson in the immediate aftermath of the
shooting. And so we got to read, for the first time, Wilson&#8217;s
full, immediate account of his altercation with Brown.</p>

<p>And it is unbelievable.</p>

<p>I mean that in the literal sense of the term: &#8220;difficult or
impossible to believe.&#8221; But I want to be clear here. I&#8217;m not
saying Wilson is lying. I&#8217;m not saying his testimony is false. I
am saying that the events, as he describes them, are simply
bizarre. His story is difficult to believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole thing is absurd. The medical examiner didn&#8217;t take photos of Mike Brown&#8217;s body <a href="https://twitter.com/aurabogado/status/537133810002190336">because his camera ran out of batteries</a>? The fix was so clearly in.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It turns out that there are differences between gradients on the
various Android devices. This is <em>not</em> a browser thing, but an
actual device thing. I compared the same gradient test on
different Android devices in Firefox, Android WebKit, and Chrome,
and found the same differences between the browsers. It became
obvious that there are incompatibilities between these Androids’
graphical &#8230; thingies, and that browsers don’t (can’t?) work
around them.</p>

<p>So I thought I’d write a snarky post embellished with some
screenshots. It was when I had made those screenshots that the
other shoe dropped: <em>the screenshots show different gradients than
the screen</em>. In other words, Android screenshots cannot be trusted
to show subtle browser differences. Actual external pictures taken
with a camera are mandatory.</p>

<p>Paul Ford, writing for The New Yorker:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might have read that, on October 28th, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">W3C officially
recommended HTML5</a>. And you might
know that this has something to do with apps and the Web. The
question is: Does this concern you?</p>

<p>The answer, at least for citizens of the Internet, is yes: it <em>is</em>
worth understanding both what HTML5 is and who controls the W3C.
And it is worth knowing a little bit about the mysterious,
conflict-driven cultural process whereby HTML5 became a
“recommendation.” Billions of humans will use the Web over the
next decade, yet not many of those people are in a position to
define what is “the Web” and what isn’t. The W3C <em>is</em> in that
position. So who is in this cabal? What is it up to? Who writes
the checks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ford achieves something extraordinary with this piece &#8212; it works well as an introduction to the world of web standards for the uninitiated, but works also as a cogent overview for those of us who are intimately familiar with the W3C (idealistic) / WHATWG (practical) political saga.</p>

<p>Bryan Jones put the iPhone 6 (regular) display under a microscope:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the iPhone 5 came out, Apple bonded the display to the glass
in an effort to get the pixels closer to the surface and Apple has
appeared to make the pixels in the 6 even closer still. Some of
what we are seeing with the iPhone 6 may be a polarizing filter
underneath the glass, but even so, the glass appears thinner and
required less focus distance adjustment to get from the surface of
the glass to the pixel on another microscope. I don’t know what
that precise distance is in microns between the surface of the
glass and the pixels, but it was a shorter distance as judged by
rotation of the focus knob in the iPhone 6 vs. the iPhone 5. What
this accomplishes is making the display appear to be higher
resolution. The blacks are blacker, contrast is higher and colors
are more vibrant, even with the same OS.</p>

<p>My thanks to John Saddington for sponsoring this week&#8217;s DF RSS feed to promote Desk, his blogging app for the Mac. <a href="http://john.do/">Saddington has been blogging</a> for more than a decade, but never found a blogging app that stuck. So, he built one for himself, focused on what matters most: <em>writing</em>. It&#8217;s called Desk, and it&#8217;s exclusively for OS X. (And it has one of the best app icons I&#8217;ve ever seen &#8212; perfect metaphor, beautifully rendered.)</p>

<p>Desk has a simple, writing-focused UI. It supports both Markdown (of course) and WYSIWYG for editing, and has direct posting support for a slew of popular platforms, including WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, Typepad, Movable Type, Facebook Notes, and Squarespace. Visually, though, Desk is utterly minimal &#8212; while you&#8217;re writing, everything fades away but your prose.</p>

<p>You can purchase a copy via the <a href="http://bit.ly/deskapp">Mac App Store</a> or check out <a href="http://desk.pm/">Desk&#8217;s beautiful website</a>. Or, follow Desk&#8217;s development through the <a href="http://blog.desk.pm/">Desk App Blog</a> (written using Desk, of course).</p>

<p>Terrific feature by Ian Urbina for the NYT Magazine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several years ago I began asking my friends and family to tell me
their passwords. I had come to believe that these tiny
personalized codes get a bum rap. Yes, I understand why passwords
are universally despised: the strains they put on our memory, the
endless demand to update them, their sheer number. I hate them,
too. But there is more to passwords than their annoyance. In our
authorship of them, in the fact that we construct them so that we
(and only we) will remember them, they take on secret lives. Many
of our passwords are suffused with pathos, mischief, sometimes
even poetry. Often they have rich back stories. A motivational
mantra, a swipe at the boss, a hidden shrine to a lost love, an
inside joke with ourselves, a defining emotional scar &#8212; these
keepsake passwords, as I came to call them, are like tchotchkes of
our inner lives. They derive from anything: Scripture, horoscopes,
nicknames, lyrics, book passages. Like a tattoo on a private part
of the body, they tend to be intimate, compact and expressive.</p>

  <p>Bluetooth Low Energy must be <em>really</em> low power: the design of
WKInterfaceObject means it’s going to be on <em>a lot</em>. Every
interaction with the watch has the potential to move actions and
data between your pocket and wrist using the radio.</p>

<p>But more importantly, this API design gives Apple a simple way to
put a cap on power consumption. We saw this approach in the <a href="http://furbo.org/2008/03/16/brain-surgeons/">early
days of the iPhone</a> and that worked out pretty well, didn’t it?</p>

<p>The gambit increases the political pressure on the European
Commission, the EU&#8217;s executive arm, to take a tougher line on
Google, either in its antitrust investigation into the company or
through the introduction of laws to curb its reach.</p>

<p>A draft motion seen by the Financial Times says that &#8220;unbundling
[of] search engines from other commercial services&#8221; should be
considered as a potential solution to Google&#8217;s dominance. It has

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple had good intentions. It kept everything close to the vest,
with a closed off development community and rigorous control over
applications. Apple has been brilliant at maintaining the purity
of the brand and until relatively recently, that has been enough
to provide additional protections against malicious attacks. But
the genie is out of the iBottle.</p>

<p>Google, on the other hand, does allow this level of collaboration.
With Android, security professionals can conduct analysis where it
matters &#8212; with operating system-level interrogation and anomaly
detection. With the Apple iOS, you can’t do that. You’re blocked
off. What is then forced is an approach that requires only looking
at the app with the AppWrapper. There is no way to develop a
guardian for the operating system, so you will never be protected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not Apple who is in trouble because iOS doesn&#8217;t allow third-party anti-virus/security software to run at the operating system level. It&#8217;s the purveyors of anti-virus/security software who are in trouble.</p>

<p>Good summary of WatchKit from Serenity Caldwell. Or rather, a good summary of this <em>initial</em> release of WatchKit. As she points out, Apple even stated <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/11/18Developers-Start-Designing-Apps-for-Apple-Watch.html">in its press release yesterday</a>, &#8220;Starting later next year, developers will be able to create fully native apps for Apple Watch.&#8221; The long and short of this initial WatchKit SDK is that the Watch acts as a remote display, with limited interactivity, for code that runs in an extension on your iPhone. Apple Watch&#8217;s system apps are not limited like that &#8212; they run natively on the watch itself. Eventually, third-party apps will too.</p>

<p>In a sense, this is like 2007 all over again. The native APIs almost certainly aren&#8217;t finished, and battery life is a huge concern. But with the Watch, Apple is ahead of where they were with the iPhone. This initial SDK is limited, but it&#8217;s way better than <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wwdc_2007_keynote">the shit sandwich</a> we got for the original iPhone at WWDC in 2007.</p>

(And it&#8217;s going to be a few years until most iOS devices in use have Touch ID.)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/07/03/location-based-security">Here&#8217;s a post from June</a> where I wrote about it, vis-à-vis an Apple patent filing for location-based security.</p>

  <p>Right now, old tweets can be found in search by switching to the
All tab of the Twitter app, and Twitter supports a basic syntax to
filter down tweets for users and dates. I was able to use two
different search operators for usernames and dates:</p>

<ul>
<li>from:username &#8212; load all tweets sent from a user;</li>
<li>since:2009-04-20 until:2009-04-21 &#8212; load tweets from
specific days.</li>
</ul>

<p>Search operators can be used in the Twitter app and combined with
hashtags and text to look more precisely in search results and
find a tweet you&#8217;re looking for. You can even save advanced
searches you come up with and reuse them at any time. And this
makes for a convenient way to delete old tweets as well: find the
tweet, and use the Delete button in the app to remove it.</p>

<p>What a great feature, and great technical achievement. The entire Twitter archive must be incomprehensibly big.</p>

<h6 class="dateline">Tuesday, 18 November 2014</h6>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/_/status/534794382420213761">this tweet from Dave Rutledge</a>, I figured how to get Google Analytics to show me the split in screen sizes for mobile devices visiting Daring Fireball. Just counting &#8220;mobile devices&#8221; for the last 7 days:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="left">Device</th>
  <th align="right">% Mobile Sessions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td align="left">320×568 (iPhone 5/5S/5C)</td>
  <td align="right">30.1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">768×1024 (all iPads)</td>
  <td align="right">29.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">375×667 (iPhone 6)</td>
  <td align="right">23.7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">414×736 (iPhone 6 Plus)</td>
  <td align="right">7.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">320×480 (old iPhones)</td>
  <td align="right">4.1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Those percentages are <em>only</em> for mobile device sessions. (Mobile devices account for 44 percent of all DF sessions.) Two points of interest to me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This is more confirmation <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/11/14/iphone6-iphone-6plus">that the split is around 3-to-1</a> between the 6 and 6 Plus. As many readers have pointed out, the 6 Plus is still supply constrained, so the split might tilt back toward the 6 Plus once both of them are available everywhere for immediate purchase.</p></li>
<li><p>There are already slightly more DF readers using one of the iPhones 6 than the iPhone 5/5C/5S combined. You&#8217;re my people.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Bonus Stat #1: iPhone 5 Adoption Back in 2012</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s no way to use screen resolutions to look at last year&#8217;s 5S and 5C launch, because their displays were the same size as the iPhone 5 from 2012. But we <em>can</em> look at 2012 and see the uptake for 4-inch iPhone 5 six weeks after it debuted.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="left">Device</th>
  <th align="right">% Mobile Sessions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td align="left">768×1024 (all iPads)</td>
  <td align="right">37.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">320×480 (older iPhone)</td>
  <td align="right">30.4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left">320×568 (iPhone 5)</td>
  <td align="right">26.2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In other words, two years ago, 26.2 percent of mobile-device-using DF visitors were using a brand-new iPhone 5. This year, for the iPhones 6 combined, that number is 30.7. Higher, but not drastically so. This could be one of those things where DF readers are very unlike the public at large &#8212; I suspect DF readers have always been the type of people who buy new iPhones as soon as they come out.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more interesting is this. In November 2012, &#8220;mobile devices&#8221; only accounted for 32.7 percent of total sessions; as stated above, today that&#8217;s up to 44 percent. In 2012, the iPad (all models combined) accounted for about 12 percent of DF sessions; today, 13 percent. So it&#8217;s roughly flat. (DF traffic overall is roughly flat too.) iPhones accounted for about 19 percent of <em>all</em> traffic to DF back in 2012; today that number is <em>29 percent</em>. The growth in mobile usage among DF readers over the last two years is almost entirely from the iPhone.</p>

<h2>Bonus Stat #2: OS Usage</h2>

<p>While I&#8217;m looking at DF&#8217;s web stats, here&#8217;s the OS usage for all sessions (not just mobile) for the last week:&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘iPhone 6 vs. 6 Plus Split Among Daring Fireball Readers’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/11/iphone_6_df_split">&#9733;</a></p>

<p>Ben Smith, Buzzfeed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A senior executive at Uber suggested that the company should
consider hiring a team of opposition researchers to dig up dirt on
its critics in the media &#8212; and specifically to spread details of
the personal life of a female journalist who has criticized the
company.</p>

<p>The executive, Emil Michael, made the comments in a conversation
he later said he believed was off the record. In a statement
through Uber Monday evening, he said he regretted them and that
they didn’t reflect his or the company’s views.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whose views do they represent then, if not his own or Uber&#8217;s?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over dinner, he outlined the notion of spending “a million
dollars” to hire four top opposition researchers and four
journalists. That team could, he said, help Uber fight back
against the press &#8212; they’d look into “your personal lives, your
families,” and give the media a taste of its own medicine.</p>

<p>Michael was particularly focused on one journalist, Sarah Lacy,
the editor of the Silicon Valley website PandoDaily, a sometimes
combative voice inside the industry. Lacy recently accused Uber of
“sexism and misogyny.” <a href="http://pando.com/2014/10/22/the-horrific-trickle-down-of-asshole-culture-at-a-company-like-uber/">She
wrote</a>
that she was deleting her Uber app after <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/french-uber-bird-hunting-promotion-pairs-lyon-riders-with-a">BuzzFeed News
reported</a>
that Uber appeared to be working with a French escort service. “I
don’t know how many more signals we need that the company simply
doesn’t respect us or prioritize our safety,” she wrote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m sure this will change Lacy&#8217;s mind about Uber. She&#8217;s probably re-installing the app right now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the Waverly Inn dinner, it was suggested that a plan like the
one Michael floated could become a problem for Uber.</p>

<p>Michael responded: “Nobody would know it was us.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is something very wrong with this company. It&#8217;s like Richard Nixon came back from the grave and is running a startup.</p>

<p>WatchKit has dropped, including the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/WatchHumanInterfaceGuidelines/index.html">Apple Watch Human Interface Guidelines</a>. There&#8217;s much to digest, but a few quick thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The displays of the two watch sizes have different pixel dimensions: 272&#8201;&#215;&#8201;340 for the 38mm Apple Watch; 312&#8201;&#215;&#8201;390 for the 42mm.</p></li>
<li><p>The system font is named San Francisco. That <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_(typeface)">rings a bell</a>. There are two versions: San Francisco Text, for sizes 19pt and smaller, and San Francisco Display, for sizes 20pt and up. Display is set tighter; Text has bigger punctuation marks and larger apertures on glyphs like &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;e&#8221;.</p></li>
<li><p>From the Watch HIG: &#8220;<em>Avoid using color to show interactivity.</em> Apply color as appropriate for your branding but do not use color solely to indicate interactivity for buttons and other controls.&#8221; Can we get this HIG guideline on iOS next year? <strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgan/status/534793433437577216">Neven Mrgan thinks</a> Apple means &#8220;use color <em>not just for</em> interactivity&#8221;, not that you shouldn&#8217;t use color alone to indicate interactivity.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of WatchKit is about offloading processing to the iPhone &#8212; the Watch is effectively a remote display for an extension running on your iPhone. This should be good for Watch battery life, but limiting when you&#8217;re not carrying your iPhone. This is not going to be a &#8220;leave your iPhone at home&#8221; device; more like &#8220;leave your iPhone in your purse or pocket.&#8221;</p></li>

<h1><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/11/native_apps_are_part_of_the_web" title="Permanent link to ‘Native Apps Are Part of the Web’">Native Apps Are Part of the&#160;Web</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Monday, 17 November 2014</h6>

<p>Christopher Mims, writing in the WSJ, &#8220;<a href="http://on.wsj.com/11hUNbi">The Web Is Dying; Apps Are Killing It</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything about apps feels like a win for users &#8212; they are
faster and easier to use than what came before. But underneath all
that convenience is something sinister: the end of the very
openness that allowed Internet companies to grow into some of the
most powerful or important companies of the 21st century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe someone is still writing this in 2014. Users love apps, developers love apps &#8212; the only people who don&#8217;t love apps are pundits who don&#8217;t understand that apps aren&#8217;t really in opposition to the open Internet. They&#8217;re just superior clients to open Internet services. Instagram didn&#8217;t even have a web interface for years, but native app clients for iOS and Android didn&#8217;t lock Instagram into anything. Their back-end is just as open as it would have been if they had only had a web browser client interface. They just wouldn&#8217;t have gotten popular.</p>

<p>I spoke about this four years ago at O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s Web 2.0 conference, in a talk titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Z_Eq95LvA">Apple and the Open Web: A Love Story</a>&#8221;. The gist of it being that native iOS apps (and native apps for Android, Mac OS X, Windows, and everything else) aren&#8217;t in opposition to the &#8220;web&#8221;. They live on top of the web. A new layer. They are alternatives to websites that run in web browsers. They&#8217;re just better clients. There are two big four-letter &#8220;H&#8221; acronyms that powered the web from the beginning: HTML (client) and HTTP (networking protocol). Native apps are just an alternative to HTML running in a web browser (and many native apps still use HTML web views embedded within the apps themselves to render parts of their interface). Almost all native apps use HTTP/S for networking, though. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s just a conceptual simplification. Instead of a web app running inside a browser running as an app inside an OS (three levels of abstraction), we just have apps running within an OS (two levels). Simpler, easier, more elegant.<sup id="fnr1-2014-11-17"><a href="#fn1-2014-11-17">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Mims continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take that most essential of activities for e-commerce: accepting
credit cards. When Amazon.com made its debut on the Web, it had to
pay a few percentage points in transaction fees. But Apple takes
30% of every transaction conducted within an app sold through its
app store, and “very few businesses in the world can withstand
that haircut,” says Chris Dixon, a venture capitalist at
Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s patently false. Even with Mims&#8217;s own example, Amazon. Just a few minutes before sitting down to write this piece, I used Amazon&#8217;s iPhone app &#8212; the one distributed through Apple&#8217;s App Store &#8212; to buy some stuff. I added items to my cart, signed in with my getting-close-to-two-decades-old Amazon account, and I was done. Apple won&#8217;t see one penny of that transaction. Not one.</p>

<p>If Amazon started using Apple Pay in their app, Apple would have gotten a fraction of a penny of each dollar I spent &#8212; but those pennies would have come from my credit card company, not Amazon.</p>

<p>Retailers who sell through native apps do not pay Apple anything, let alone 30 percent. What Apple charges 30 percent for are purchases for <em>in-app digital content</em>. I can&#8217;t buy Kindle books in the Kindle app, or Amazon MP3 music, because of this &#8212; but I can buy everything else from Amazon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Web was intended to expose information. It was so devoted to
sharing above all else that it didn’t include any way to pay for
things &#8212; something some of its early architects regret to this
day, since it forced the Web to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/technology/personaltech/banner-ads-the-monsters-that-swallowed-the-web.html?_r=0">survive on advertising</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Says the guy writing for the site with a rather strict paywall.</p>

<p>And exposing information, freely, is where the web continues to thrive (says me, the native app proponent who publishes everything I write on a freely-accessible website). If something works great as a web app, let it be a web app. (There are some great web apps, perfectly suited for what they are.) If something works better as a native app, let it be a native app.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Web wasn’t perfect, but it created a commons where people
could exchange information and goods. It forced companies to
build technology that was explicitly designed to be compatible
with competitors’ technology. Microsoft’s Web browser had to
faithfully render Apple’s website. If it didn’t, consumers would
use another one, such as Firefox or Google’s Chrome, which has
since taken over.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let me get this straight. Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer &#8220;was explicitly designed to be compatible with competitors’ technology&#8221;. I can&#8217;t wait until Jeffrey Zeldman reads this. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-08-06/jeffrey-zeldman-king-of-web-standardsbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice">From a 2007 Businessweek profile of Zeldman</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This concept may seem obvious today, but during the Browser Wars
of the 1990s, Microsoft and Netscape each claimed close to
50% of the market, and their browsers were almost entirely
incompatible. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon to type in a URL and find that
the site didn&#8217;t work. Companies eager to open their virtual doors
had to invest in multiple versions of their sites. In short, it
was a bad situation for businesses and consumers alike. Yet the
browser makers were behaving as many software companies do &#8212; by
trying to out-feature the competition with the introduction of new
proprietary technologies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to Mims:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In a lot of tech processes, as things decline a little bit, the
way the world reacts is that it tends to accelerate that decline,”
says Mr. Dixon. “If you go to any Internet startup or large
company, they have large teams focused on creating very high
quality native apps, and they tend to de-prioritize the mobile Web
by comparison.”</p>

<p>Many industry watchers think this is just fine. Ben Thompson, an
independent tech and mobile analyst, told me he sees the dominance
of apps as the “natural state” for software.</p>

<p>Ruefully, I have to agree. The history of computing is companies
trying to use their market power to shut out rivals, even when
it’s bad for innovation and the consumer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How has the rise of native mobile apps been anything but a renaissance of innovation? I&#8217;d argue we&#8217;ve seen far more innovation in the iPhone era (2007-2014) than from 2000-2007. I can&#8217;t see how anyone would argue that we&#8217;ve seen <em>less</em> innovation. We used to print driving directions from mapping websites; now we get audible turn-by-turn directions on our devices. The pre-mobile web was largely about consumption for most people: reading articles, watching videos, buying stuff. In today&#8217;s world, everyone is creating and sharing their own content &#8212; everything from photos to videos to their thoughts and observations. Mims claims native mobile apps are &#8220;bad for innovation and the consumer&#8221; while consumers around the world are doing remarkably innovative things using native mobile apps.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That doesn’t mean the Web will disappear. Facebook and Google
still rely on it to furnish a stream of content that can be
accessed from within their apps. But even the Web of documents and
news items could go away. Facebook has announced plans to host
publishers’ work within Facebook itself, leaving the Web nothing
but a curiosity, a relic haunted by hobbyists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is where Mims most betrays his conflation of client software and &#8220;the Web&#8221;. For the sake of argument, imagine a world where all native apps went away. A world where we do everything through web browsers like Safari, Chrome, Mozilla, and IE. In that world, Facebook could do exactly the same thing &#8212; &#8220;host publishers&#8217; work within Facebook itself&#8221;. Exactly the same thing. The control Facebook is exerting here has nothing to do with native mobile apps in particular. They&#8217;ve <em>always</em> locked non-Facebook users (like me) out of most content posted to Facebook. Now they&#8217;re just talking about hosting even more Facebook-only content.</p>

<p>Arguments about &#8220;open&#8221; and &#8220;closed&#8221; often devolve into unresolvable cross-talk where the two sides have different definitions of what <em>open</em> and <em>closed</em> really mean. But the weird thing about a truly open platform is that its openness allows closed things to be built on top of it. In broad strokes, that&#8217;s why GNU/GPL software isn&#8217;t &#8220;open&#8221; in the way that BSD software is (and why Richard Stallman <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">outright rejects</a> the term &#8220;open source&#8221;). If you expand your view of &#8220;the web&#8221; from merely that which renders inside the confines of a web browser to instead encompass all network traffic sent over HTTP/S, the explosive growth of native mobile apps is just another stage in the growth of the web. Far from killing it, native apps have made the open web even stronger.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Native Apps Are Part of the Web’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/11/native_apps_are_part_of_the_web">&#9733;</a></p>

compact size, higher image quality, and improved functionality.
This is the industry&#8217;s first CMOS image sensor for smartphones to

processing function to achieve excellent focus tracking of
fast-moving subjects. The High Dynamic Range (HDR) function, which
captures both backgrounds and subjects clearly and vividly even in

<p>Looks impressive &#8212; and Apple has long used Sony sensors for iPhone cameras. (Sony&#8217;s specs only list video frame rates going to 120 FPS &#8212; the iPhone 6 supports 240. Not sure if that&#8217;s only for HDR video, though.)</p>

<p>My thanks to Igloo for once again sponsoring last week&#8217;s DF RSS feed. Most &#8220;intranets&#8221; suck. They&#8217;re ugly, badly designed, and people wind up avoiding them by just emailing file attachments back and forth.</p>

<p>Igloo bills itself as &#8220;an intranet you&#8217;ll actually like&#8221;. I&#8217;d say they&#8217;re <em>the</em> intranet that doesn&#8217;t suck. You get all sorts of cool features, like Twitter-like microblogs, file sharing, comments on everything, and the design can match <em>your</em> brand across all devices. It&#8217;s easy to use, and easy to setup, with no technical expertise required.</p>

<p>Still need convincing? <a href="http://vimeo.com/64886237">They even have a Sandwich video</a>. Amazingly, Igloo is free to use for up to 10 people. <a href="http://igloosoftware.com/df">Try it for free</a> and see for yourself.</p>

<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> The site has been taken offline, <a href="http://fireballed.org/linked/2014/11/16/wholesale-phone-company/">but there&#8217;s a cached version hosted at Fireballed.org</a>, which includes all the good stuff. It&#8217;s just missing an image or two.]</p>

<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/533693712719962112">tweeted</a> this yesterday, and still can&#8217;t stop laughing about it. It&#8217;s a counterfeit iPhone 6 being for $250. So many gems on this web page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This phone is <em>the same as the Apple iPhone 6 without the Apple
logo</em> on the back of the phone or the iPhone 6 text on the white
box (sometimes the phone comes with an Apple like logo). The
internals of this phone are the same as the Apple iPhone 6.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do NOT pay $600, $700 or even $800 for the same phone.</p>

<p>The quality, finish &amp; performance of this phone is the same as the
Apple iPhone 6.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the specs list: </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li>Video recording: Yes</li>
<li>E-book format: Excel, PPT, Word</li>
<li>Screen resolution: 854&#8201;&#215;&#8201;480 pixels</li>
<li>Gravity Sensing System</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Who hasn&#8217;t enjoyed reading a good .xls novel? But it gets better: they embed an unboxing video from someone who specifically emphasizes in the video just how bad the performance of the phone is. The people selling this phone chose to embed that.</p>

<p>I think my favorite thing, though, is the photograph of a warehouse at the very bottom of the page. (<a href="https://twitter.com/dbbrian/status/533699454717554688">Ripped-off</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joelhousman/status/533696469971517441">of course</a>.) There are no words to accompany it, but the implication is that this enormous, airy, well-lit, clean warehouse is where they&#8217;re selling these phones from. Convincing!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m half-tempted to buy one of these on a lark.</p>

<p>I really enjoy reviews like this one by David Ruddock at Android Police. It&#8217;s often very interesting to read something from the point of view of someone more deeply attuned to another platform. This, from the list of &#8220;cons&#8221; for the iPad, caught my eye:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li>Is an iPad, will result in some people thinking you&#8217;re an Apple
sycophant / the kind of person who lingers at coffee shops for 8
hours a day.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I often need reminding just how weird some people&#8217;s ideas are about Apple and Apple users.</p>

<p>Substantially, these few bits stood out to me. Battery life:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Standby life on the Nexus 9 isn’t fantastic, either - I’m getting
around 15% idle drain quite reliably every 24 hours, which is
absolutely at odds with Google’s 30-day standby estimate. Even if
you don&#8217;t agree with my assessment of the usage time life,
Android&#8217;s idle drain is still an absolute embarrassment. I could
let my first Air sit for a week untouched and the battery gauge
would barely budge - maybe a few percent. Android has never been
great about this, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to be getting much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Safari vs. Chrome:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can throw benchmarks and timed tests at me until you&#8217;re blue
in the face - mobile Safari kicks Chrome&#8217;s ass every day of the
week. The smoothness alone is evidence to me that while Google may
care about a browser&#8217;s technical proficiency, Apple cares at least
as much about its usability and consistency, if not more.</p>

<p>Chrome for Android&#8217;s usability is a victim of Google&#8217;s
cross-platform utopian vision, and for now, it&#8217;s just not a
fantastic touch browser. Safari may not always be faster in every
benchmark or timed comparison, but it&#8217;s smoother in all the ways
that matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The feel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From a smoothness and stability standpoint, iOS 8 feels so much
more refined and predictable than Lollipop does on the Nexus 9.
Apple is known for obsessing over things like animation draw times
and smooth scrolling, trying to create an experience that never
feels jarring or rough around the edges. Apple seems to toil
indefatigably to ensure those home screen swipes and launch
animations are perfect every time. Moving to the more powerful A8X
chip with three cores now means that smoothness persists even
during app installs or other background operations, an area where
the first Air occasionally would have difficulty.</p>

<p>This is such a huge thing, for me, from a UX standpoint. Google
has tried to instill these values in Android with things like
Project Butter, but it&#8217;s never seemed to pan out exactly in the
way I think we all hoped would. The obsession with smoothness in
iOS is almost religious. In Android, it&#8217;s always seemed like an
attitude of &#8220;hey, if you can keep things at around 60FPS, that&#8217;d
be great or whatever.&#8221; I realize animations and such things are
far more aesthetic than functional, but they can have a huge
effect on how you perceive performance and feel about a device.
Using the iPad just <em>feels</em> nicer, I don&#8217;t find myself getting
annoyed by it nearly as often as the Nexus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This ties into one of my recent themes here on DF, regarding Google&#8217;s own iOS apps, and the asymmetry of the Google/Apple Android/iOS rivalries. Ruddock is clearly an Android guy, but more so than that he&#8217;s a <em>Google</em> guy. He can use an iPad and still have a Gmail app, still have a Google Maps app, still use Google Docs, etc. Google&#8217;s wide support for iOS makes it a lot more likely that an all-in Google platform user might prefer an iPad to an Android tablet.</p>

<p>Take it with a grain of salt since the numbers don&#8217;t come from Apple, but interesting if true. 3-to-1 sounds about right to me.

<p>Connie Loizos, reporting for Strictly VC:</p>

  <p>Sources who spoke to StrictlyVC and asked to remain anonymous say
Fadell has fashioned a hierarchical structure reminiscent of TV’s
“Game of Thrones.”</p>

<p>According to one employee, “Almost every decision, no matter how
small,” goes through either Fadell or Matt Rogers, who cofounded
Nest with Fadell and was previously a senior manager at Apple.
(Through a spokesperson, Fadell and Rogers declined to answer
questions for this story.)</p>

<p>“It’s always, ‘Tony and Matt want us to do this. We have to hit
this deadline because Tony and Matt want us to.’ You definitely
see people taking the path of least resistance because they don’t
want to upset Tony.”</p>

<p>Another employee calls it a “huge meeting culture, to the point
where anyone at the director level or up spends their entire day
in meetings, many of them duplicative meetings about the same
subject, over and over to the point where a lot of people have
complained.”</p>

<p>Alex Epstein makes the case that Apple&#8217;s claim that its &#8220;data centers are powered by 100 percent renewable energy sources, which result in zero greenhouse gas emissions&#8221; is fraudulent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine this scenario: Apple CEO Tim Cook wants to take an ocean
liner across the Atlantic. He has a problem. Ocean liners run on
oil but Cook wants to be “green.”</p>

<p>What can he do?</p>

<p>Well, he could try his luck with a sailboat. But the wind is
volatile and unreliable &#8212; not to mention that a wind-swept voyage
across the ocean would be dangerous.</p>

<p>But then, when all hope seems lost, Apple Board member Al Gore
offers an idea. Use an ocean liner, but install sails on top, so
that at least part of the time the boat is at least partially
powered by wind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Epstein is the author of a new book titled <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Moral-Case-Fossil-Fuels/dp/1591847443/">The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels</a></em>, so he&#8217;s clearly coming at this from a certain perspective.</p>

in a way that enhances both, as is the case with the Glif and Slow

with &#8220;ads&#8221;, but the ad is simply for our other products? You know,
the products that actually make money?</p>

with Slow Fast Slow. As of today, you can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slow-fast-slow/id727309825?mt=8">download</a> Slow Fast Slow

<h1><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/11/googles_app_aesthetic" title="Permanent link to ‘Google’s App Aesthetic’">Google’s App Aesthetic</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Monday,  3 November 2014</h6>

<p>New today: updated Android apps <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/11/a-new-day-for-google-calendar.html" title="Official Gmail Blog: A New Day for Google Calendar">for Google Calendar</a> and <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/11/a-more-modern-gmail-app-for-android.html" title="Official Gmail Blog: A More Modern Gmail App for Android">Gmail</a>. Both look interesting &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/529380058238947328" title="Tweet from Benedict Evans.">as Benedict Evans succinctly put it</a>, “Google is reworking Mail and Calendar from database displays to task-led interfaces. I wonder how far they&#8217;ll take that.” </p>

<p>And intriguingly, as Google&#8217;s new &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec" title="Google’s Material Design spec">material&#8221; design</a> language evolves, it&#8217;s very clearly heading in a different direction than iOS. Talking about <em>flatness</em> is simply too superficial to be a useful discussion. Superficially, iOS and Android seemingly converged toward flatness (and Windows Phone, of course, was there already), but once you get past those surface similarities, all three mobile platforms are evolving in noticeably different ways.</p>

<p>But Google’s “Material Design” isn’t merely the design language for Android, it’s the design language for all the company’s software. One result of this is that Google&#8217;s iOS apps feel less and less like iOS apps with each major release. To me, they look and feel like Android apps running on iOS. Android users might disagree with that assessment, as much of what makes a good Android app Android-y is not how the software <em>looks</em> but the way it interacts with the system. But these Google apps certainly don’t look or feel quite like iOS apps. Their brand-new you-need-a-beta-invitation <a href="http://www.google.com/inbox/">Inbox app</a> is also interesting (I got an invitation last week), but even though it&#8217;s a brand-new app, if anything, it feels <em>less</em> like an iOS app than Google’s other iOS apps. For one thing, Inbox uses a blue background for the status bar, which is the system-standard cue to indicate that cellular tethering is engaged. Another example: None of the Google iOS apps I have on my iPhone (Maps, Gmail, Inbox) support the iOS standard swipe-from-left-edge shortcut to go back in the view hierarchy. That&#8217;s a two-year-old standard design pattern for iOS, and I find it downright essential with the bigger displays on the new iPhones. (In hindsight, it seems fairly obvious that Apple added this gesture in iOS 7 because they knew then that bigger-screen iPhones were in the pipeline.)</p>

<p>One last thought. Lost in the competition between platforms (iOS vs. Android) is the more philosophical competition between native and in-browser web apps. In the early days of iOS, say, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/11/iphone_web_apps_alternative" title="Yours truly, back in 2009: “iPhone Web Apps as an Alternative to the App Store”">circa</a> 2008-2011, it was easy to conflate these two battles in public debate, because Apple was seen as the primary proponent of native app development, and Google was seen as a proponent of cross-platform web apps. No more. Google today (like Facebook) seems all-in on native apps, at least (again, like Facebook) for post-PC devices. Just a few years ago, I used to see a lot more arguments from web-app proponents that native apps&#8217; dominance on mobile devices would be short-lived. I don&#8217;t see so much of that any more.</p>

<p>One reason some people argue in favor of in-browser HTML/CSS/JavaScript web apps is that it&#8217;s the last bastion for <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere">write-once-run-everywhere</a></em>. The lament I hear most frequently about mobile development is that if you want to reach the widest possible audience, you have to write at least two apps, iOS and Android. If you include Windows Phone, now you&#8217;re up to three. My take has always been: Tough luck. The point of making apps shouldn&#8217;t be about making life easier for developers, it&#8217;s about making the best possible apps for users. If you value user experience above developer convenience, it&#8217;s easy to see why native apps are winning the war. But even on the desktop, with PC browsers, write-once-run-everywhere is often just a pipe dream. <a href="/misc/2014/11/wally-world-is-closed.png">Here&#8217;s the screen I see</a> when I try to log into the desktop web app version of Google Inbox using Safari on OS X Yosemite.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think the web version of Inbox is Chrome-only because Google wants to lock people into Chrome. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s about spite. I think it was just a practical decision that fell out of a desire to push the limits of the in-browser web app experience, rather than limit themselves to a common baseline of functionality available across the <em>X</em> top browsers. Cynics surely look at this as the second coming of Microsoft&#8217;s IE-only web technologies from the late &#8217;90s, but my guess is that support for additional browsers <em>is</em> coming, that Safari is probably high on that list, and they shipped Chrome-first only because it was the fastest way they could ship. One reason Google created Chrome in the first place was to have a browser they controlled to better enable the sort of web apps they wanted to build.</p>

<p>In short, though, a Chrome-only app from Google &#8212; even if only temporary &#8212; is not how the world of standards-supporting web apps was supposed to work, in the aftermath of the breakup of Microsoft&#8217;s IE hegemony. But I’m not surprised. Practicality trumps idealism in the long-run, and the idea that the post-IE world of web browsers would lead to a world of universal cross-platform software is pretty much the definition of an idealistic crusade.</p>

<p>I see a certain irony in all this. Google is cultivating a single look-and-feel for their apps. But for mobile they’re creating them as separate native Android and iOS apps. But their latest web app for desktop PCs, Inbox, only runs in one browser, Chrome.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Google’s App Aesthetic’" href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/11/googles_app_aesthetic">&#9733;</a></p>
