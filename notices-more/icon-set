Ultimate Free Icon Set: 1000 Free Icons

This design resource freebie — containing 1,000 free vector icons — is the biggest free icon set that Six Revisions has ever released. These icons can help create a better reputation and user experience for your site.

This freebie comes in three formats:

PNG – a popular web format that’s ready to use (read about the PNG image format here)
EPS – an editable graphics vector file that you can open and edit in vector-editing software like Adobe Illustrator and CorelDRAW
AI – the original vector file that you can open and edit in Adobe Illustrator
This freebie was created exclusively for the Six Revisions readers to enjoy by Freepik.com — a search engine that helps graphic and web designers find high-quality photos, vectors, illustrations, and PSD files for their creative projects. As you can see it is great for a large variety of industries, from a golf course’s site to a locksmith’s. There is an icon for just about everything in this set.
